# rust-todo
A command line Rust application for storing and maintaining a todo list.
Stores todos in a basic text file on disk (probably in the working directory).


### MVP goals

- [X] Basic text-based UI
- [X] Option to save to disk
- [X] Option to reload todos from disk
- [X] Option to create new todos
- [X] Option to edit existing todos
- [X] Option to mark todos as complete
- [ ] Option to delete todos

## Stretch goals

- [ ] Improve UI to allow for cursor control and highlighting of todos in the list
- [ ] Add groups for todos (e.g. home, work)
- [ ] Add due dates for todos (a todo that is due should highlight in red)
- [ ] Add tags to todos (e.g. chore)
- [ ] Create projects of todos (similar to groups but geared towards a common goal)
- [ ] Add status to todos (e.g. in progress, waiting for something)
